				<h3 >Plan Ahead, Map Out Your Epic Roadtrip</h3>
				<p>You would never build a dream house without a blueprint. So, don’t launch a new website without mapping out these basics:</p>

					<div class="img-holder">
						<img src="img/elements/lp_assets/img-holder-1.png" alt="img-holder"/>
					</div>
					<div class="text-holder">
						<h4>What’s the essence of my site? </h4>
						<p>Define the purpose of your site. If you are looking to sell goods, strong ecommerce tools are key.
							Bloggers need a simple control panel and both content and editing tools for frequent updates.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="features">
					<div class="img-holder">
						<img src="img/elements/lp_assets/img-holder-2.png" alt="img-holder"/>
					</div>
					<div class="text-holder">
						<h4>Who am I targeting?</h4>
						<p>The fact that billions of people can access your site does not mean that you should target them all.
							Identify your user base and establish the appropriate language and presentation to meet their needs.</p>

					</div>
					<div class="text-holder">
						<h4>What’s my budget? </h4>
						<p>Basic website building packages start around $5 per month and can go above $20 with eCommerce tools,
							analytics and hosting. There are website building solutions that meet every budget. Identify your
							price point to get started in the right direction. Some website builders, like <a href="wix.com">Wix</a>,
							even offer free access to their website building tools.

				<h2>Step 2</h2>
				<h3>Name It, Choose a Domain</h3>
				<p>Choose a name that’s catchy and represents the essence of your site. Avoid using hyphens or numbers which can
					be misheard or confused with letters when said out loud. If you can't find a .com domain, there are many other
					valid suffixes to choose from, such as .biz, .co, and .mobi. If you are looking to be modern and fashionable,
					.ly and .me domains are the latest trend.
				</p> <br/>
				<p>
					Did you know that the internet exploded from 1 website in 1991 to 1 billion registered sites in 2014? That
					explains why most of the .com domains are already taken, even oddballs like carrots-for-life.com or
					kittyarmy.com.

				<h2>Step 3</h2>
				<h3>Make It Pretty, Design your Website</h3>
				<p>Do you want an original design? The <a href="http://web.com">Web.com</a> staff of professional designers can create a custom design for your
					site in about a week. If your budget is more limited, don't worry: the market of free and cost-effective premium
					website templates offers many options. If you’re a DIY go-getter on a limited budget, website builders like Wix
					and Weebly offer professional templates, intuitive drag-and-drop design tools and easy text and image editors
					that let you piece together a product gallery or design your blog posts in minutes.
				</p> <br/>
				<p>
					Check out some of the most popular template designs from the top websites builders
					<a href="http://www.top10bestwebsitebuilders.com/website-templates">here:</a>
				</p>
				<div class="screenshot">
					<img src="img/elements/lp_assets/screenshot.jpg" alt="screenshot"/>
				</div>
				<p>
					Designing a site includes more than picking a theme. It’s also the time to consider which features will elevate
					your site to a whole new level. If you’re building an online store, now’s the time to check for shopping cart
					functionality. If you’re hoping to start a popular blog, you’ll want to be able to support user comments. If your
					website is going to showcase your creative talent, you might need powerful image galleries or multimedia
					capabilities. Whatever you’re looking for, you’ll find thousands of templates which offer all of the above and
					more, all suitable for beginners in web design.

				<h2>Step 4</h2>
				<h3>Laying Bricks, Develop and Program</h3>
				<p>Content is used to describe everything you want to provide on your website, whether that’s text, images,
					multimedia or widgets to provide extra functionality. Whatever type of website you are building, you will
					want an easy to manage control panel to build new content and edit the existing. There are plenty of
					options that give you the ability to create both complex and simple sites, depending on the amount of time
					and effort you're willing to invest. Read more about your low-tech web builder options
					<a href="http://www.top10bestwebsitebuilders.com/how-to-create-a-website/business/webcom-vs-godaddy.">here</a> ,
					no coding skills necessary.
				</p> <br/>
				<p>
					Keep in mind that 30% of your visitors are likely to view your website on their phones or tablets, so you
					need to make sure your site looks great on smaller displays. Creating a website which suits mobile devices
					means that it will adjust text, images and formatting automatically to fit properly on smaller screens, and
					work for touchscreen, like a smart phone or tablet.

				<h2>Step 5</h2>
				<h3>Adding the Flesh, Create Content</h3>
				<p>When it comes to drawing visitors to your site, you likely fall in one of three categories: business card site,
					online shop, or blog. If you are looking to create a brochure site for your brick-and-mortar business, providing
					customers with your address, hours of operation, and phone number all in one place, you probably won’t need to
					put many resources into marketing.
				</p> <br/>
				<p>
					If you’re an online shop, it’s in your best interest to set aside some of your budget for marketing costs. This
					might include linking the website with a company Facebook page, and running promotions to find new customers.
				</p> <br/>
				<p>
					If you have a blog, the best way for people to find you is by uploading fresh content regularly. A good web
					builder will automatically make sure your blog is found with search engines such as Google, and the more you
					post, the better chance people have of finding your website. A user who searches for a romantic idea to surprise
					their spouse, may stumble across your recipe blog and find the perfect menu option for a candlelit dinner. If you
					upload new content regularly, not only will search engines continue to suggest your blog to potential readers,
					but it will keep those visitors coming back for more.
				</p>  <br/>
				<p>
					Content isn't just text, it also means images, videos, and other graphics. Choosing the right pictures for the
					site is a very important step. You can obviously take pictures yourself and use them, but sometimes you may need
					to use stock images. These are images which are copyright free.
					<a href="http://www.godaddy.com">GoDaddy is a smart site builder option</a> if you are looking for a service that
					includes stock photos. Each theme includes a set of corresponding high-quality photosthat users are welcome to
					incorporate into their site design.

		<div class="container" id="step-6">
			<div class="content">
				<h2>Step 6</h2>
				<h3>Warm Up, Test Your Site</h3>
				<p>All websites take up space. That space has to come from somewhere! That’s where hosting comes in. Your website host
					will provide that space on a server, which is essentially a large computer. This connects your website to the
					World Wide Web, allowing visitors to find you, and is also responsible for elements such as the speed of your
					website, how much content you can store on it, and how complex that content is. If you haven’t already signed up
					for a hosting plan as part of your website building package, this is the time to do it. All-in-1 website service
					solutions like <a href="http://www.ipage.com">iPage</a> provide hosting options plus website design.
				</p> <br/>
				<p>
					Right before (and after) launching your website, it's crucial to test it for speed, errors and bugs, like broken
					links or ill-fitting images. You can do this by clicking on all your links to confirm that they work, monitoring
					how fast your pages load, and reading through all the content to make sure there are no errors. (It’s a good idea
					to try all of this on multiple devices too.)
				</p> <br/>
				<p>
					<a href="#">Wix offers a Get Feedback feature</a>, which enables you to share the draft mode of your site with friends and
					coworkers and incorporate their feedback before you hit the publish button.

			<div class="content">
				<h2>Step 7</h2>
				<h3>Spread the Word, Market Your Website</h3>
				<p>Keep your target audience in mind when considering marketing channels. Can you advertise using your offline
					business, providing incentives to customers to visit your online counterpart? If you use social media already,
					you might have a user base ready and waiting as followers on Facebook. Perhaps your website builder offers
					tutorials on the kinds of content and keywords you could use to get noticed more by the search engines.
				</p> <br/>
				<p>
					Your website builder might also offer what’s known as analytics. This is essentially data about who is visiting
					your website. It will show you how many visitors you have had, and break this down into when they found you,
					what they looked at, and even where they logged on from. This can help you see how successful your marketing is,
					and what parts of your website are the most popular.
				</p> <br/>
				<p>
					As your site grows and matures, your needs might change. If you experience an increased number of users, start
					selling products on your site, or add a blog, you might need to upgrade your subscription to allow for added
					functionality or hosting provisions.
				</p>  <br/>
				<h4>Conclusion</h4>
				<p>
					See, it really is that simple. Follow these 7 steps to create a strong online presence that’s built to last.
					With a billion websites built to date, it’s clear you don’t need a degree in computer science to put your blog,
					business site, or portfolio online. It’s time to broadcast your voice globally.
